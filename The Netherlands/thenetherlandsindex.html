              There are around 80 different kind of drops: sweet, salt, hard, soft and combined with other taste like
              wine-gum and fruits.</p>

              It's always held on his birthday itself: the 27th of April.The Dutch celebrate his birthday with lots of
              music, dancing, flea markets and fun fairs.
              And the dresscode:orange! It's one of the biggest and most colourful festivities in the Netherlands.
              And an opportunity to see the King and his family from closeby. </p>

            <p> When a baby is born, the Dutch have 2 rituals. They put a wooden stork in the garden who is carring a
              baby.
              Often the name of the baby is also mentioned. And on their work and at home the parents hand out "beschuit
              met muisjes."
              Beschuit is a round, toasted, dry, and crunchy rusk that is smeared with either margarine or butter, then
              topped with muisjes â€“ sugar-coated aniseeds.
              Of course blue if it's a boy or pink when it's a girl. It's rude to refuse such treat if it's offered to
              you.</p>
