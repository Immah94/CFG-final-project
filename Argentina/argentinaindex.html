        <p> Alfajores are traditional Argentine pastries that have creamy dulce de leche caramel as the main ingredient. 
          <br>There are different types but at least it is needed to have two cookies with that caramel between them. 
          <br>The different variants change the ingredients to make the cookies (ex. Corn or wheat flour, fruit flavour) and the coating (chocolate, white chocolate, grated coconut) 
          <br>Other countries in Latin America have similar pastries.</p>

      <div class="intro"> 
      <p> Regardless of the socioeconomic status of the citizens, most people in Argentina drink Mate. The main ingredient is the yerba mate inside a cup called mate as well. 
        <br>Most prefer to drink it hot through a ‘bombilla’ (straw), but it is also common to drink it cold or with juice instead of water (‘tereré’). 
        <br>Some people add sugar, fruit or other herbs to attenuate the characteristic bitter taste of the yerba. 
        <br>Many drink mate alone while studying or watching TV, but it is widespread to drink mate with friends as a social gathering. 
        <br>There are social roles that aren’t fixed but usually, one person in the group is in charge of putting hot water into the gourd (this person is called ‘cebador’) and passing it to each of the group members.
        <br>Other countries in Latin America have a similar tradition</p>

        <p> Asado not only food is a social ritual that brings friends and family together. 
          <br>There are no written rules about the guests’ roles, however, each of them tries to contribute to the gathering. 
          <br>Some say that the person who grills the ingredients doesn't go to the shop or doesn't make the salad. It's an excuse to make a great result with teamwork. 
          <br>The ingredients are different Argentinean cuts beef (including the “asado” itself) and other internal parts of the cow pig and chicken. </p>
